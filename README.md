# EntropicConicUOT
This notebook implements some of the algorithms proposed in the paper *Toric Geometry of Entropic Regularization*, by Bernd Sturmfels, Simon Telen, Fran√ßois-Xavier Vialard and Max von Renesse. https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01571

The purpose of the notebook is to illustrate the computational section of the paper which puts forward the use of generalized iterative scaling algorithm (proposed by Darroch and Ratcliff in statistics).
This algorithm might save computational time when compared with coordinate ascent.
More details are provided in the paper and the notebook.

Disclaimer: the implementation is far from being optimized. We consider it as a proof of concept.
